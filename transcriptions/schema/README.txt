These schema were all generated using the TEI-Roma website 
available at http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/

To make changes to the schema use load the TEI-NTMSS.xml using the 
'upload a customization' function on the ROMA homepage.  

You can then use the modules tab to include or exclude modules and/or elements/attributes.

Use the save cusomisation tab to save your current customisation.

To export the schema use the schema tab. You should always download a 
'RELAX NG schema (XML syntax)' and a 'W3C schema (in Zip archive)' 

It is vital that all schemata are kept in synch with each other (different formats are 
needed for different tools) and also that your saved customisation is in synch with the 
schemata.

NB: The last time I generated this schema from Roma there was an error that led to two 
part attributes being declared for ab tags which made the scemata generated unusable. 
Thankfully the problem is easy to fix. Simply open the schemata in turn in Oxygen and 
it will highlight the problem area you can then delete the section of XML highlighted and
all will be well.
