Future Directions
---

This proof of concept tool would benefit from many additions.

We would like to see:

* the option to take a screen shot of a specified area of a screen rather than always the whole screen
* the ability to annotate a screenshot to highlight a particular area such as a button or text field
* the tool work with non-browser based GUIs (this would need an alternative automation tool as Selenium only works with browsers)
* easy integration with continuous integration tools such as Jenkins
* 

This file provides information of features that we would like to include in this tool:

1, Simplest use case - automate a screen shot of a GUI web app into html documentation.
2, Next use case is to campare this image with the previous image. If the previous image is different repace the screen shot in the html documentation.
3, Create a list of screen shots of a GUI web app for a functional section.
4, Trgger the running of the tool by a python script per image with a master python script to run it all.
